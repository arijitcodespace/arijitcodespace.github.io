# Hi!

Welcome to my site. You'll find my **papers** on the Publications page and occasional notes on the **Blog**.

# About
I graduated from Jadavpur University with a Bachelors in Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering (2021) and continued with two consecutive Masters from the Indian Institute of Science (2023) in Signal Processing and then from the University of California, Los Angeles (2024) in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently I am a data scientist at SymviQ India Pvt. Ltd. and independent researcher seeking PhD positions worldwide.
